# Erkle üîÄ

> Smart contract workflow automation

A small CLI tool which accelerates the process of deploying, migrating and replacing addresses across your contracts, interface and subgraph.

# Why üßê

Working on a project, i found myself going through multiple folders and files after a new deployment or migration to change the address of contracts and replace ABIS with new versions.

## Installation ‚ú®

Erkle requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

In your favorite terminal, enter and run the following.

```sh
npm install -g @pelicandistress/erkle
```

## Usage

An erkle configuration file is required for this to work, here's an [example config](https://github.com/carterax/erkle/blob/main/examples/erkle-config.json).
After each run, if you ran the replace tasks the new string for each task is automatically inserted into `replace.tasks[index].replace` for the next run.

```sh
erkle --config="/path-to-config/erkle-config.json"
```
